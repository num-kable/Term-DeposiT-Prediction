# Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions
This project uses logistic regression to predict customer subscriptions to term deposits, based on key attributes like age, campaign duration, and loan history. The model achieved 89.4% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.95, enabling banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve conversion rates.

 # Key Features
Model: Logistic regression for binary classification.
Data Preprocessing: Normalization of outliers (e.g., age, balance) for improved accuracy.
Performance Metrics: Strong precision and recall with F1 = 0.95.
 # Business Impact
The model helps banks focus on high-potential customers, optimizing marketing efforts and driving term deposit subscriptions.

# Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional customer attributes for deeper insights.
Explore advanced ML techniques (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) for better performance.
